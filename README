In this repository both a talk about Perl 6 is written, and a software is
being developed that emits HTML slides.

The talk will be held at the Erlangen.pm perl mongers group, possibly on May
18th.

The software is written out of an acute NIH syndrome, and for the lack of
alternatives known to the author. It is by no means ready for general usage.
