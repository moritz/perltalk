In this repository both a talk about Perl 6 is written, and a software is
being developed that emits HTML slides.

The talk will be held at the Erlangen.pm perl mongers group, possibly on May
18th.

The software is written out of an acute NIH syndrome, and for the lack of
alternatives known to the author. It is by no means ready for general usage.

To generate the slides, run

    perl process.pl

Currently two HTML versions are generated: in out/0000.html, out/0001.html
etc. a version with one file per slide. A second version is generated in
s5/index.html, which contain all slides in one file (and requires javascript).

This latter version is based on s5 <http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/>.
