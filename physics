= Perl 6 and the Real World - Structure

    * What is a model? When is it a good model?
    * A simple model
    * Math: derivatives
    * ...

= What is a Model?

    * Physics = striving to understand (parts of) the world
    * The world is too complicated
    * Models are descriptions that focus on one aspect
    * So Model = Simplification

= Example Model

    # TODO: image of person on a swing

    # + black'n'white schema

= Model takes into account
    
    * Gravity
    * Inertia
    * Initial motion

= Model neglects

    * Colors
    * Exact shapes
    * size of object
    * Friction

= Is it a good model?

   * It's a good model if it can answer a question for us
   * Examples "how fast is the object?", "What is the swinging period?",
       "Does the distance to the anchor point matter?"
   * Accuracy of the answer important
   * Every model needs input data. Is that available?
   * Externsibilty

= Another model: free falling

# TODO: image

= Free falling: Solved in Perl 6
:perl6

    use Math::Model;

    my $m = Math::Model.new(
        derivatives => {
            velocity      => 'height',
            acceleration  => 'velocity',
        },
        variables   => {
            acceleration  => { $:gravity },   # m / s**2
            gravity       => { -9.81 },       # m / s**2
        },
        initials    => {
            height        => 50,              # m
            velocity      => 0,               # m/s
        },
        captures    => ('height', 'velocity'),
    );

    $m.integrate(:from(0), :to(4.2), :min-resolution(0.2));
    $m.render-svg('free-fall.svg', :title('Free falling'));

= Model result

# TODO: image

= The model in detail

:perl6

    use Math::Model;

    my $m = Math::Model.new(
        derivatives => {
            velocity      => 'height',
            acceleration  => 'velocity',
        },

= Derivative: slope of another quantity

# TODO: image explaning derivative

= Common derivatives in Mechanics
:text

    Derivative          Of

    velocity            position
    angular velocity    angle
    acceleration        velocity
    power               energy
    force               momentum
                        (= mass * velocity)

= Common derivatives
:text

    current             charge

    birth  rate         population
        - mortality rate

    profit              funds

= Using derivatives

    * With Math::Model, you only need to know the derivatives,
      note the values derived from
    * You need an initial value for the derived quantity
    * (Ordinary Differential Equation, which Math::Model integrates for you)

= Extending the model

    * Let's add a spring (force upwards)
    * Some damping
    * Damping is propotional to velocity, but in opposite direction

= Spring, gravity, damping

# TODO: source code

= Spring, gravity, damping: results


= Spring, gravity, damping: results

 * It oscillates (surprise, surprise)
 * it has an intrinsic frequency: "eigen frequency"
 * Amplitude decreases due to damping

= Further extensions

 * Let's add an external, driving force
 * Example: motor, coupled through a second spring

= External driving force: Code

# TODO: source code

= External driving force: Result for low frequency
:raw

#TODO: images

= External driving force: Observations

    * Amplitude low for small frequencies
    * Amplitude high for driving freq = eigen freq
    * Amplitude goes to zero for very high frequencies

= Amplitude vs. Frequency

# TODO: image

= Resonance controls

    * tune of music instruments
    * light absorption, thus color of objects
    * heat transport in solids (phonons are lattice resonances)
    * everything else :-)

= String theories

    * some physicists say that particles are just resonances
    * the things that move are called "strings"
    * think of it what you want :-)
